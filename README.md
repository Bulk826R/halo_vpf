The figures in the paper are in the "./figures" directory
Each "./figX" directory where X is the label of the figure in the published version of the paper, contains the code that were used to generate the corresponding plot.
The "./redMaPPer" directory contains the original redMaPPer cluster and random Poisson point data used in this project.
